# Tangerieve

Tangerieve (an anagram of "generative") is a project to explore and explain various concepts that are used when creating generative art.

*Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).*

## Concepts

- Simple
  - Pixel Manipulation
  - [TODO] Perlin noise
- Animated
  - [TODO] Time deltas
- Mathematical
  - Function-to-Pixel Mapping (e.g. `(x * x) + (y * y)` to a 2d color gradient)
  - [TODO] Roses
